          Corda does not rely on hostname verification in the P2P protocol to
          identify a host, so is not impacted by this vulnerability. Corda uses
          its own SSL identity check logic for the network model. Corda
          validates based on the full X500 subject name and the fact that P2P
          links use mutually authenticated TLS with the same trust roots. For
          RPC SSL client connections Artemis is used which calls into netty. The
          default value for verifyHost is true for Artemis client connectors so
          verification of the host name in netty does occur.

          This is a build time vulnerability. It relates to the inability to
          lock dependencies for Kotlin Multiplatform Gradle Projects. At build
          time for Corda we do not use Multiplatform Gradle Projects so are not
          affected by this vulnerability. In addition as it is a build time
          vulnerability released artifacts are not affected.

          This vulnerability relates to information exposure via creation of
          temporary files (via Kotlin functions) with insecure permissions.

          susceptible to this vulnerability.

          This component is used to upgrade the node database schema either at
          node startup or via the database migration tool. The XML input for the
          database migration is generated by Corda from either R3 supplied XML
          files included in corda.jar or those XML files written by the CorDapp
          author included in a CorDapp that is installed in the node CorDapps
          directory. Contract CorDapps received over the network are not a
          source of XML files for this generation step.  An attacker trying to
          exploit this vulnerability would need access to the server with the
          XML input files, and specifically the access and ability to change JAR
          files on the file system that make up the Corda installation.

          This vulnerability relates to the interpolation of configuration
          properties performed by commons-text. This allows configuration
          properties to be dynamically evaluated and expanded. The set of
          default interpolators included with commons-text include ones that
          could execute code and contact remote servers. In Corda, Apache
          commons-text 1.9 is being used by Apache commons-configuration 2.8,
          which is being used by Apache artemis 2.19.1. We do not use
          configuration files with artemis. In addition commons-configuration
          2.8 is already handling this vulnerability in that it removes from the
          default list of interpolators in commons-text those interpolators that
          can execute code or access a remote server. For these reasons Corda is
          not susceptible to this vulnerability.
